# JetSeT notebooks for the Sexten 2025 Workshop
Notebook describing how to use the basic functionalities of JetSeT during the Sexten 2025 workshop.

Please visit [this website](https://jetset.readthedocs.io/en/1.3.0/install.html), and follow the instructions to install JetSeT. Python >=3.9,<=3.11 is suggested.<br>
The JetSeT code is well documented and users are referred to the [ReadTheDocs](https://jetset.readthedocs.io/en/1.3.0/index.html) for any questions/doubts.

## Summary of the notebooks
The aim of these notebook is to provide a basic overview of the main functionalities of JetSeT. They offer a starting point to make comparisons between your data and model.<br>
Furthermore, we will use the JetSeT code to illustrate spectral behaviours predicted by leptonic (SSC) models.<br>

There are three notebooks, and it is recommened to run them in this order:<br>
1. JetSeT_physical_setup.ipynb : tutorial showing the basic steps to build a SSC model. We will discuss some spectral trend predicted by SSC scenarios when certain parameters arr varied.
2. JetSeT_SED_fitting.ipynb : tutorial showing how a model can be fitted to your data, and how physical constraints can be imposed to the fitting routines.
3. JetSeT_SED_twozone.ipynb : tutorial showing how multiple components can be added to your model. To justify the need of mutiple components, we will discuss the effects of synchrotron self-absorption (SSA).
